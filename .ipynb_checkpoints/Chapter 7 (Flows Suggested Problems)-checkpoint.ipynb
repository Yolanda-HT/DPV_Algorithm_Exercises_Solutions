This is unfortunate because  the flow f uses that particular edge at full capacity: fuv = cuv.  We could redo the flow computation from scratch, but there’s a faster way.

    "Direct bipartite matching. We’ve seen how to find a maximum matching in a  bipartite graph via reduction to the maximum flow problem. We now develop a  direct algorithm.  Let G = (V1 ∪ V2, E) be a bipartite graph (so each edge has one endpoint in V1  and one endpoint in V2), and let M ∈ E be a matching in the graph (that is, a set  of edges that don’t touch). A vertex is said to be covered by M if it is the endpoint of one of the edges in M. An alternating path is a path of odd length  that starts and ends with a non-covered vertex, and whose edges alternate  between M and E − M.  \n",
