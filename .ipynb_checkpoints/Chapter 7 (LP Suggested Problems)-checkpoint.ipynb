    "* **Flow to Shortest Path:** Because the edge lengths $l_e$ are positive and there are no capacity constraints, the flow that minimizes the total cost must be an **integral** flow (a single path), even if we initially consider fractional flows. If a minimum cost flow $f$ were fractional, it could be decomposed into a set of paths and cycles. Since $l_e > 0$, any cycle in the flow must have a positive cost, and removing this cycle would not violate the flow constraint but would reduce the total cost, which contradicts the minimality of $f$. Thus, the optimal flow $f$ of size 1 must correspond to a single $s-t$ path, and minimizing $\\sum_e l_e f_e$ is equivalent to minimizing the length of that path.\n",

    "\n",
    "**The reason for the difference is the choice of the primal LP.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Your Primal LP (b):** Your primal is a **minimum cost flow** problem finding a flow of size 1 between *just $s$ and $t$*. The objective $\\sum l_{uv} f_{uv}$ seeks the shortest $s-t$ path.\n",
    "2.  **The Textbook's Dual Interpretation:** The dual on page 209 is the dual of a different primal problem: one that seeks to find a set of $\\mathbf{s-u}$ paths, for all $u$, where the objective is to maximize $x_t$ (which represents the distance $d(s, t)$) subject to the **triangle inequality** constraints ($x_v \\leq x_u + l_{uv}$) and a boundary condition ($x_s = 0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crucially, your dual LP and the textbook's dual are mathematically equivalent ways to express the shortest path problem.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's show the connection:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **If you set $x_s' = 0$** in your dual and let $x_u' = x_s - x_u$, then $x_u'$ represents the shortest path distance $d(s, u)$.\n",
    "    * **Objective:** $x_s - x_t = x_t'$ (Maximizing the shortest path distance to $t$).\n",
    "    * **Constraint:** $x_u - x_v \\leq l_{uv}$ becomes $(x_s - x_v) - (x_s - x_u) \\leq l_{uv}$, which simplifies to $x_u' - x_v' \\leq l_{uv}$, or $x_v' \\geq x_u' - l_{uv}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard textbook dual typically **sets $x_s = 0$** and then has constraints ensuring that $x_v \\leq x_u + l_{uv}$, where $x_u$ is interpreted as $d(s, u)$. Your dual is more general as it doesn't fix $x_s$ to 0, which is natural when dualizing the flow formulation where the supply/demand is just an $s-t$ pair.\n",
