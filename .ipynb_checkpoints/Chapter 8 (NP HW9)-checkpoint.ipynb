    "In order to show this, we will show that TSP-OPT reduces to TSP in polynomial time. The idea of this reduction is to use binary search with the 𝑏 input for TSP to find the length of the shortest tour (then TSP will find the shortest tour itself). Let the distance matrix be denoted 𝐷. First, we need to find an upper bound 𝐵 for the length of the shortest path. We can set 𝐵 to be the sum of all distances in the distance matrix (so 𝐵 = Σ𝑖,𝑗 𝐷𝑖,𝑗). Then, we run TSP with inputs 𝐷 and 𝐵/2. If this finds a tour with length at most 𝐵/2, then we know the shortest tour has length in the range [0, 𝐵/2]. Otherwise, the shortest tour has length in the range [𝐵/2, 𝐵].\n",

    "Here is where we can apply binary search; for each successive iteration, run TSP on the midpoint of the remaining range for the length of the shortest path, then eliminate half of the range based on whether TSP finds a tour. Continue this recursive process until the range is narrowed to a single integer number, then return the path found by TSP on this integer. TSP will be run 𝑂(log 𝐵) times (since this is a binary search from 0 to 𝐵). The input size of TSP-OPT must be of length 𝑂(log 𝐵), since 𝐵 was the sum of all the distances in 𝐷. Therefore, this reduction is polynomial, and if TSP can be solved in polynomial time, then so can TSP-OPT."

Given a proposed satisfying truth assignment 𝑆 for 𝑓, we can just check clause by clause that 𝑆 satisfies at least one literal in each clause; this takes 𝑂(𝑛) time per clause and thus 𝑂(𝑛𝑚) total time. Then in 𝑂(𝑛) time, we count how many variables are set to be TRUE in 𝑆 and check that the number is larger than 𝑘 or not. Overall, this is dominated by 𝑂(𝑛𝑚) and is thus polynomial.\n",

Likewise, if STINGY SAT returns that there is no such assignment, then there can be no solution to the SAT problem. The only transformation between SAT and STINGY SAT was setting 𝑘 = 𝑛; the input formula f and resulting truth assignment from STINGY SAT remain unchanged, so our transformations take O(1) constant time (which is polynomial).\n",
