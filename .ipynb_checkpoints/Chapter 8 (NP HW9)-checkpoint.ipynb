We know that the CLIQUE problem in general graphs is NP-complete, so it  is enough to present a reduction from CLIQUE-3 to CLIQUE. Given a graph G  with vertices of degree ≤ 3, and a parameter g, the reduction leaves the  graph and the parameter unchanged: clearly the output of the reduction  is a possible input for the CLIQUE problem. Furthermore, the answer to  both problems is identical. This proves the correctness of the reduction  and, therefore, the NP-completeness of CLIQUE-3.  \n",

    "(c) It is true that the VERTEX COVER problem remains NP-complete even when  restricted to graphs in which every vertex has degree at most 3. Call this  problem VC-3. What is wrong with the following proof of  NP-completeness for CLIQUE-3?  We present a reduction from VC-3 to CLIQUE-3. Given a graph G = (V, E)  with node degrees bounded by 3, and a parameter b, we create an  instance of CLIQUE-3 by leaving the graph unchanged and switching the  parameter to |V| − b. Now, a subset C ⊆ V is a vertex cover in G if and  only if the complementary set V − C is a clique in G. Therefore G has a  vertex cover of size ≤ b if and only if it has a clique of size ≥ |V| − b.  This proves the correctness of the reduction and, consequently, the  NP-completeness of CLIQUE-3. "
