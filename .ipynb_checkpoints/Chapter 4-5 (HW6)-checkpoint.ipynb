    "(a) Algorithm:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Run Dijkstra’s algorithm from 𝑣0 to get all distances from 𝑣0 to all vertices in 𝑉 . Reverse the graph\n",
    "and run Dijkstra’s again from 𝑣0 - the output corresponds to the distances of the shortest path from\n",
    "all other vertices to 𝑣0 in the original graph. For any pair of vertices 𝑢, 𝑤 ∈ 𝑉 , the shortest distance\n",
    "from 𝑢 to 𝑤 using a path through 𝑣0 will be the sum of the two distances, 𝑢 to 𝑣0 in the reverse\n",
    "graph and 𝑣0 to 𝑤 in the original graph. Any single path 𝑢 ⇝ 𝑣0 ⇝ 𝑤 may be recovered using the\n",
    "prev[] arrays which result from each run of Dijkstra.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "(b) Justification of Correctness:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "This algorithm works because our graph is strongly connected, meaning that a path exists between\n",
    "every pair of vertices. We also know that Dijkstra’s, given a starting vertex and non-negative edge\n",
    "weights, will find the shortest path from that starting point to every other vertex. Reversing a\n",
    "directed graph essentially reverses the direction of the path between any pair of vertices. So, the\n",
    "shortest path from 𝑢 to 𝑤 which includes 𝑣0 is the combination of the shortest path from 𝑢 to 𝑣0 in\n",
    "the reversed graph plus the shortest path from 𝑣0 to 𝑤 in the original graph.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "(c) Runtime Analysis:\n",
    "Each round of Dijkstra’s takes 𝑂((𝑚 + 𝑛) log(𝑛)) which simplifies to 𝑂(𝑚 log 𝑛) since the graph\n",
    "is strongly connected. Building the reverse graph takes 𝑂(𝑛 + 𝑚) time. Obtaining the necessary\n",
    "structures (dist[] and prev[]) from which the shortest paths can be obtained is thus 𝑂(𝑚 log 𝑛).\n",
