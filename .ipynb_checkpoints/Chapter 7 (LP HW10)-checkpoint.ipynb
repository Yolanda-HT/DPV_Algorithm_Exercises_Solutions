    "Moe is deciding how much Regular Duff beer and how much Duff Strong beer to  order each week. Regular Duff costs Moe \\\\$1 per pint and he sells it at \\\\$2 per  pint; Duff Strong costs Moe \\\\$1.50 per pint and he sells it at \\\\$3 per pint. However,  as part of a complicated marketing scam, the Duff company will only sell a pint  of Duff Strong for each two pints or more of Regular Duff that Moe buys.  Furthermore, due to past events that are better left untold, Duff will not sell Moe  more than 3,000 pints per week. Moe knows that he can sell however much beer  he has. Formulate a linear program for deciding how much Regular Duff and  how much Duff Strong to buy, so as to maximize Moe’s profit. Solve the  program geometrically. \n",

    "The Canine Products company offers two dog foods, Frisky Pup and Husky  Hound, that are made from a blend of cereal and meat.
